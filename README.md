# My React Starter Config

This is a landing page example built in React with Bootstrap 4 and fullpage.js.
### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dikadj/weberration-landing.git
$ cd weberration-landing/
$ yarn install && yarn start
```

Then open browser on localhost:3000, I deactivate auto open browser since it's a little annoying. Well, enjoy. ('-')/
